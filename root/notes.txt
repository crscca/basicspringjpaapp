I have not put any test cases in the JPA layer yet.
There are 2 types of integration test cases inside the webapp layer.

The first type of integration test case mocks the server layer but otherwise does the complete testing
The other integration test case actually launches the server, deploys the app and runs the test casess.

Only functionality currently being tested is a create user entity.

Steps to test.
•	execute /root/mysqlsteps.txt
•	edit /root/setenv.bat
•	run /root/build.bat in a shell set to the root project path will execute the integration test mocking the web input and output
•	run /root/testintegration.bat bat in a shell set to the root project pathto execute both type of integration tests
