Environment:
Java6
maven 3
mysql

Project structure:
root - parent pom project
jpamodule - java maven module
webmodule - webapp maven module

I have not put any test cases in the JPA layer yet.
There are 2 types of integration test cases inside the webapp layer.

The first type of integration test case mocks the server layer but otherwise does the complete testing
The other integration test case actually launches the embedded server, deploys the app and runs the test casess.

Only functionality currently being tested is a create user entity.

Steps to test.
•	execute /root/mysqlsteps.txt
•	edit /root/setenv.bat
•	run /root/build.bat in a command shell set to the root project path will execute the integration test mocking the web input and output
•	run /root/testintegration.bat in a command shell set to the root project pathto execute both type of integration tests

TODO:
Improve the JPA spring DI and configuration
Improve the test casees
\root\webmodule\src\test\java\com\sample\json\UserControllerTests.java - ex of mock test case
root\webmodule\src\test\java\com\sample\json\UserControllerIT.java -ex of full integration test case

Other notes:
Generic data access object- do we need so many types ?

Things to discuss investigate:
Alternate Spring data approach

Also Note:
Some of the code is from the chapter we refrred to.
